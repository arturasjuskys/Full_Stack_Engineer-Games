  "description": "Node.js game, entry point through command line. Game objective is to find the hat and avoid holes on grid based map.\r ### Start the game\r Terminal => node app.js\r ### Environment variables\r app.js => file bottom => game.generateField();\r ### Game controlls\r * u - up\r * r - right\r * d - down\r * l - left\r ## Improvements\r * Ask at start of the game how big the map player wants\r * After loosing the game ask if player wants to start new game\r * Create Web App out of this\r * [Solved] Have the character start on a random location that’s not the upper-left corner.\r * Create a “hard mode” where one or more holes are added after certain turns.\r * Improve your game’s graphics and interactivity in the terminal. There are many helpful packages to assist with this, and you can really get creative with how you approach terminal games.\r * Create a field validator to ensure that the field generated by Field.generateField() can actually be solved. This might be pretty difficult! You’ll essentially be creating a version of a maze solver.",
